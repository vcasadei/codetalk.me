## Colophon
This website is entirely [static](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Static_web_page): it works only with HTML and CSS, and does not use any dynamic language. Each page requires only one request! Particular attention is paid to [typography](http://webtypography.net/) and to [vertical rhythm](http://webtypography.net/2.2.2).

The pages are produced with the static website generator [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/). The website is then hosted and served thanks to [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/). 

Each page header is illustrated with a part from the ["Turgot" map of Paris](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turgot_map_of_Paris), created in the 18^(th) century by Louis Bretez.
