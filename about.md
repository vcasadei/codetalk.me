###This is <a href="{{ site.url }}/" title="{{ site.title }}">**{{ site.name }}**</a>, *{{ site.description }}*.

In this blog you will find several posts about *new technologies*, *design* and *coding*. The goal here is to produce content that is useful for both the experienced and inexperienced developer and for everyone who is interested on discovering and sharing knowledge.

This is a hobby that is taken seriously, so it's not a main activity, but it's a great project that gives a lot of enthusiasm.

You an find most of the content in *English* and also in *Portuguese* (my mother laguage), there may be some differences between the content, and the reason is due to cultural differences or country-targeted issues, so don't worry about that.
